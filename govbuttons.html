                                    <h3>Project Objective</h3>
                                <p>This project was proposed to my superiors over at the New Mexico House of Representatives in order to modernize the committee rooms' voting system from a primarily verbal system to a digitally recorded one.<p>
								<p>It is aimed at replacing private-owned voting systems, which are currently in use, with inexpensive, reliable and in-house developed options that will save the House of Representatives up to $80,000 in equipment and installation alone.</p>
                                    <h3>Project Synopsis</h3>


                                    <h3>Project Details</h3>
                                <p>The project consists of two main parts: The hardware and software.<br /></p>
                                <h4>Hardware</h4>
                                    <p>The hardware part of the project is comprised of the controllers and the receiver. In order to keep the project cheap and simple to assemble, while being able to operate in a room with multiple oncoming and outgoing signals; it was decided that the main method of communication between devices would be through a 433Mhz RF transmitter/receiver combo.
                                    Transmitters are made off 3 large buttons which interact with the custom PCB [consists of an ATtiny814 IC, a voltage regulator, the 433Mhz transmitter and a USB-C connection] and send a unique signal depending on the button that is pressed.
                                    As for the Receiver, it consists of an RF receiver attached to a microcontroller which will serially communicate with the room's primary computer, on which itll locally store all of the legislators' voting data and voting count, to later upload to the main database.</p><br />
