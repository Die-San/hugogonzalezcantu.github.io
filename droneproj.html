                                    <h3>Project Objective</h3>

                                <p> </p>
                                <p>I primarily served as a testing engineer and Mechanical Designer for this project. Designing the numerous chassis in SOLIDWORKS, I was eventually able able to mount all of the parts on the drone, get it to fly, and even had it survive a +200ft free fall without any visible or technical damage to components. Under my supervision, the drone was able to meet and surpass the original minimmum design specs (fly 17 meters/s, atleast 200ft vertical and 60 ft horizontal distance from controller without losing camera quality, etc) through numerous tests designed and carried out by all of us in the team. Played a great part in designing the custom transmitter (controller) for the drone, which was needed to activate the "guns" in augmented reality. Designed a custom PCB and controller-backplate that'd universally fit drone transmitters. If youre interested in hearing more about the project and its development, the project report file is avaliable through the following button in Google Drive.</p>

                                <h4>Software</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The software segment primarily consists of very simple code that will go on each of the 15 transmitters that will be placed in front of the legislators' seats. Simply put, each button on each of the 15 units will output a different signal in this format:  (05 01 1), which Would mean, in room 305, seat #1, (Yes).</li>
                                    <li>The Receiver, which will be under the committee room's computer desk, or alternatively sitting in the server rack inside the room, will be in charge of decoding all of the received signals, and then relay them to the PC via serial communication or other alternate forms of communicaiton such as bluetooth.</li>
                                    <li>The custom software that will run on the PC along with the receiver will be in charge of popping up a window on the committee screens and official stream, and then show and keep track of which representative votes YES, NO, or EXPL (to signal that they wish to explain something regarding their decision). </li>
                                    <li>The software will also locally store a .txt or .xlsx file with all information for that specific vote. When a vote is over, the app will store the data and go on to the next template to store the last vote separately. This data will then be sent to the House of Representatives' database.</li>
                                </ul>
