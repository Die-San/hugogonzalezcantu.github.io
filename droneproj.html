                                    <h3>Project Objective</h3>
                                    <p>Fight Flight is a project aimed at revolutionizing the FPV and drone fighting markets. The project integrates real drone-operating experience with fun and engaging drone combat via augmented reality, all from your computer. By incentivizing users to battle with their drones in a virtual space, all while operating the drone in the real-world environment, we aim to increase the overall skill-level of users. <br />

                                        In order to play the game, one simply needs a computer with the game installed, a pair of the custom-made controllers we designed, equipped with extra buttons means to control the "guns" the user will digitally equip their drone with, and two FPV capable drones. One must simply open up the game, tell the game what color chassis each drone has, pick an in-game class with different "guns" each, and finally to play the game, use the FPV camera output from each drone as a monitor with a built-in crosshair. Since drones can only take "damage" by being in the other's crosshair at the time of "shooting" with the custom controller, it is recommended to maneuver around the air and keep away from the opponent's crosshair while keeping them in yours. <br />
                                        
                                        This is what incentivizes smarter and higher-level skill, while training users to better maneuver drones in dangerous environments.</p>
                                        
                                        
                                        
                                        For this project, I served as a testing engineer and mechanical engineer. Designed numerous drone chassis iterations in SolidWorks; after 9 iterations, the drone chassis was able to meet the basic specifications set for it at the beginning of the project: 
                                        <ul>
                                        <li>Capable of surviving a +200ft fall without breaking or damaging any of the components mounted to it. </li>
                                        <li>Light enough to take off without straining the motors.</li>
                                        <li>Thick enough on important areas, thin enough in less important areas; flexible to absorb vibrations and physical damage received.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                        
                                        As the testing engineer, it was my duty to:
                                        <li>overlook drone design specifications</li>
                                        <li>ensure drone's current capabilities as opposed to the minimum standards set by the team at the beginning of the project.</li>
                                        <li>prototype test flying, game testing and recording test data</li>
                                        <li>sensor testing both when equipped on the drone or the sensor on it own.</li>
                                        
                                        I had a major hand in the manufacturing of the drone as a whole by granting design advice for the Flight Controller (FC), connecting the non-standard parts together via soldering and custom connectors better fit four our application, as well as playing a major part in designing the custom controller.

                                <h4>Software</h4>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The software segment primarily consists of very simple code that will go on each of the 15 transmitters that will be placed in front of the legislators' seats. Simply put, each button on each of the 15 units will output a different signal in this format:  (05 01 1), which Would mean, in room 305, seat #1, (Yes).</li>
                                    <li>The Receiver, which will be under the committee room's computer desk, or alternatively sitting in the server rack inside the room, will be in charge of decoding all of the received signals, and then relay them to the PC via serial communication or other alternate forms of communicaiton such as bluetooth.</li>
                                    <li>The custom software that will run on the PC along with the receiver will be in charge of popping up a window on the committee screens and official stream, and then show and keep track of which representative votes YES, NO, or EXPL (to signal that they wish to explain something regarding their decision). </li>
                                    <li>The software will also locally store a .txt or .xlsx file with all information for that specific vote. When a vote is over, the app will store the data and go on to the next template to store the last vote separately. This data will then be sent to the House of Representatives' database.</li>
                                </ul>
